## Motivation

This lab exists purely to answer the question, "How do I get started with network programmability?"  This project 
simply exists to bootstrap traditional network administrators and engineers to get started down the path of effective
network programmability. 

## Show Me!

We will have fun with Ninja-themed metaphors: We will introduce you to the Network Programmability Dojo; teach you 
the Tools of the Ninja; allow you to Hone your Ninja Skills; and, finally, Test Your Ninja Skills with real-world use 
cases at the end of this lab.

We hope you have fun and learn valuable new skills!
