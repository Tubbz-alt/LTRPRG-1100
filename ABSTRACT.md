# Abstract

The session will answer the questions: What is network programmability?  How do you get started with network 
programmability?  How do Cisco products support network programmability? and more.  The session is targeted at 
engineers who have made the decision to embrace network programmability but aren't quite sure how or where to get 
started. Participants will learn what are the foundational programming skills needed; the essential tools and 
resources; the protocols and data models used in Cisco products; and an introduction to Application Programming 
Interfaces (APIs) through an interactive, hands-on session.  At the end of the session, participants will have 
completed a number of exercises solving common networking problems using network programmability in IOS XE.  The 
session is not meant to be a Python programming tutorial.
