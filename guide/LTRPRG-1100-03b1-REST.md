## REST APIs

### Introducing REST APIs

APIs based on web services and the HTTP protocol have been prevalent for over 20 years.  As the World Wide Web itself
matured and websites evolved from static content to complex dynamic content, a need arose for websites hosted on 
multiple servers to be communicate with each other.  Two web-based APIs are predominant, SOAP and REST, with REST
becoming the de facto standard most recently.

Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for designing connected applications.  A web service 
or API that conforms to the REST architectural style are described as being "RESTful".  Roy Fielding is credited as 
defining REST in his PhD dissertation "[Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm)"
at UC Irvine in 2000.

In this lab, we will further introduce basic RESTful concepts, using Cisco DNA Center as an example relevant to the 
Network Programmability Ninja.
