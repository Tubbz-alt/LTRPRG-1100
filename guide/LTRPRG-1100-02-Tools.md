# Tools of the Ninja

## What are the Tools of the Network Programmability Ninja

Among the essential tools of the traditional Ninja are the iconic Ninja Star.  In this lab, we share with you the 
most essential tools for the Network Programmability Ninja.  These tools are chosen with a few common criteria:

* They are ubiquitous in the community and industry.
* They are available to use for free (although some have additional optional for-pay features or services available)
* They are cross-platform, support Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and various Linux distributions.
* They are essential for being highly effective and efficient Network Programmability Ninjas, either independent from
or part of a larger community.

Of course, there are many other tools you can pick up after mastering these, some more specialized than others, but 
these tools will get you started down the right path.  This is by no means an exhaustive list, and you may need to 
specialize in new or different tools over time for your specific circumstances.

In this lab, we highlight the following:

* Git and GitHub
* Python
* Cisco Webex Teams
* Postman

Let's get started with an introduction to a few essential tools of the Network Programmability Ninja!
