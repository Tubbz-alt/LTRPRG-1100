### Exercise 1: Creating a GitHub Account

#### Objectives

The objectives for this exercise are to:

* Create a GitHub account
* Explore GitHub

#### Step 1: Creating a GitHub Account

Although creating a GitHub account is not required to clone Git repositories hosted on GitHub, why not join and 
participate in one of the largest developer communities on the Internet?  Doing so gives you the opportunity to see 
what other people are working on or are interested in, learn how software is built by following projects, and share 
your work - no matter how small - with the community.  Cisco product teams, Cisco DevNet, and Cisco SEs all share and
collaborate through GitHub.

1. Open a web browser and navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/): `https://github.com/`.
2. On the GitHub homepage, fill out the form to [Sign up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home), choosing a 
unique username, entering your email address, and creating a password.  Click the `Sign up for GitHub` button.
3. Choose the personal plan `Unlimited public repositories for free.`  Optionally click to select `Send me updates on
GitHub news, offers, and events`.  Click the `Continue` button.
4. Tailor your GitHub experience by answering the questions.  Click the `Submit` button.

Congratulations, you have joined the GitHub community!

#### Step 2: Exploring GitHub

1. Projects are stored in a repository, or repo for short.  This is where all of the project materials are 
hosted, including, but not limited to, documentation and source code.  You can star a repository so that you can keep
track of projects that are of interest or importance to you.  Starring a repository is also a way to show your 
support for, or appreciation of, the project and project maintainers.  Take a few minutes to discover new 
repositories.  Click the `Star` button to the right of a repository title on the project's site.
    
    Search for and star this Cisco Live session project repository:
    
    * [LTRPRG-1100: Cisco Live US 2019 Instructor Led Lab](https://github.com/curtissmith/LTRPRG-1100)
    
    Search for and star common Python modules used for network programmability in general, and in this lab 
    specifically:
    
    * [ncclient: A Python module for NETCONF clients](https://github.com/ncclient/ncclient)
    * [textfsm: A Python module for parsing semi-structured text into python tables](https://github.com/google/textfsm)
    * [requests: A Python module for HTTP requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests)

2. You can follow people of like-mindedness or of other interest to you and your goals on GitHub.  This can help you 
build a network and community of developers.  When you follow people, you will see their public activity in your GitHub 
news feed after you login to GitHub.  Take a few minutes to follow new and interesting people on GitHub to start 
building your developer network.  Click the `Follow` button under their profile image on their profile page. 
    
    Search for and follow your Cisco Live lab proctors:
    
    * [Curtis Smith](https://github.com/curtissmith) (`curtissmith`)
    * [Matthew Galazka](https://github.com/mgalazka) (`mgalazka`)
    
    Share your GitHub username in this lab's Cisco Webex Teams space.  Search for and follow your fellow Cisco Live lab 
    participants!

3. People can collaborate on multiple projects as a business or open source project under a GitHub organization.  
Rather than collaboration projects being hosted by individuals, people and projects can be managed as a organization.
For example, Cisco has an organization where its Systems Engineers can share projects with their customers.  Cisco 
DevNet has an organization in support of its mission.  These organizations keep projects and project maintainers and 
contributors under one umbrella.  Organizations cannot be followed or starred, but do take note of and bookmark a few
organizations as a way to explore GitHub more.

    Search for and bookmark the [Cisco DevNet](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet) organization where sample code from 
    Cisco DevNet is shared.
    
    Search for and bookmark the [Cisco Systems Engineers](https://github.com/CiscoSE) organization where sample 
    code from Cisco SE community is shared.
