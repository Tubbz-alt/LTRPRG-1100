## Cisco Webex Teams

### Introducing Cisco Webex Teams

Cisco [Webex Teams](https://www.webex.com/products/teams/index.html) is a platform for teamwork, communication, and 
collaboration. It allows individuals and teams to communicate via messaging, video meetings, whiteboarding, and more.
On the surface, it may not be obvious how it is relevant to the Network Programmability Ninja.  However, with a 
well-developed API, Webex Teams can be integrated into your network programmability workflow.

Through a robust API, Webex Teams can act as a bidirectional human interfacing tool with network programmability.
Webex teams supports the concept of Integrations and Bots, providing a platform and framework for new and interesting 
applications and use cases outside of traditional Unified Communications applications.  Webex Teams could be a platform 
for network devices to communicate alerts, status changes, or other information. It could also provide a way for a 
network operator to query a network device for interface statistics using human language. This level of extensibility
brings much to the table for the Network Programmability Ninja.

Let's introduce Webex Teams next; a real-world use case with Webex Teams integration is included later in this lab.
