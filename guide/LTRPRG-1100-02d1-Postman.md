## Postman

### Introducing Postman

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a development environment focused specifically on working with application 
programming interfaces (APIs). An API is a well-defined structure that allows communication between different pieces
of software. Many network engineers are aware that a Cisco Catalyst or Nexus switch has a command line interface where 
users can type well-defined commands and receive expected output. Some may be surprised to learn that the same 
Catalyst or Nexus switch also has an API where users can send specific queries and receive structured responses ideal
for programmatic consumption.

We will discuss APIs in greater depth later in this lab.  But first, let's introduce Postman as tool to be used to 
explore and learn RESTful APIs.
