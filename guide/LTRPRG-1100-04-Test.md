# Test Your Ninja Skills

## Put Your Network Programmability Ninja Skills to the Test

Your Network Programmability Ninja training has reached the point where it is time to put your Ninja tools and skills to
the test.  It is our intention to show you how to put the tools we've introduced to you and the skills you honed with
those tools to wrap up this lab with a few example use cases.

In this lab, we highlight the following:

* Troubleshoot High CPU with Network Programmability
* Script a Switch Port Tracker
* Script a Network Programmability Assistant for Cisco Webex Teams

If you are up to the test, then continue on!
